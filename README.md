# ToN-Special-Sign
A sign that will help you keep track of the rounds in ToN!

ToN Sign by MinnieFops!

# Requirements:

- VRCFury (or ModularAvatar)
- ToN Save Manager

# How to use/install:

- drag the "ToN Sign" prefab on to your avatar (located in Assets / MinnieFops / ToN Sign / ToN Sign.prefab)

- VRCFury will do the rest upon building your avatar.

- Inside of the ToN Save Manager settings menu, make sure you enable "Send OSC Parameters"

- Also enable "Send Master Change" in the OSC category

- Reset OSC Config in-game (expression menu / options / OSC / Reset Configs)

- Enable OSC on your avatar in-game (expression menu / options / OSC / Enabled)

The sign needs a special round to occur first so it can align to the classic/special pattern, so it will be "[???]" until a special round occurs or host leaves.

It will automatically pick up on host leaving and set round to "special"
